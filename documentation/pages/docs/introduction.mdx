# Getting started

&zwnj;<UseGesture /> is a set of gestures that let you bind mouse and touch events to any node.

With the data you receive, it becomes easy to set up complex gestures like dragging and pinching with a few lines of code.

## React

In React, <UseGesture pkg="react"/> consists in multiple hooks you can attach to a component. You can use the library as standalone, but to make the most of it you should combine it with an animation library like [react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring).

### Installation

```bash
yarn add @use-gesture/react
npm install @use-gesture/react
```

### Simple React example

<Code id="PullRelease" />

The following example makes a <EasterDiv><code>&lt;div/&gt;</code></EasterDiv> draggable so that it follows your mouse or finger on drag, and returns to its initial position on release.

```jsx
import { useSpring, animated } from '@react-spring/web'
import { useDrag } from '@use-gesture/react'

function PullRelease() {
  const [{ x, y }, api] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }))

  // Set the drag hook and define component movement based on gesture data
  const bind = useDrag(({ down, movement: [mx, my] }) => {
    api.start({ x: down ? mx : 0, y: down ? my : 0, immediate: down })
  })

  // Bind it to a component
  return <animated.div {...bind()} style={{ x, y }} />
}
```

### How does this work?

The `useDrag` hook returns a function (stored in the `bind` constant), which when called returns an object with event handlers. Here, when you spread `{...bind()}` into a component, you're actually adding `onMouseDown` and `onTouchStart` event handlers.

> It's important that you understand <UseGesture pkg="react" /> is not responsible for actually moving the component. The `useDrag` hook just hands over gesture data to react-spring which sets the component transforms. If you're not familiar with react-spring, head over [its documentation here](https://react-spring.io).

## Vanilla javascript

Although <UseGesture /> was originally built for React, v10 is now platform agnostic, and can work in vanilla javascript.

### Installation

```bash
yarn add @use-gesture/vanilla
npm install @use-gesture/vanilla
```

### Simple Vanilla example

<Code id="Vanilla" />

The following example makes a <EasterDiv><code>&lt;div/&gt;</code></EasterDiv> draggable so that it follows your mouse or finger on drag, and returns to its initial position on release.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div id="drag" />
```

```js
// script.js
const el = document.getElementById('drag')
const gesture = new DragGesture(el, ({ active, movement: [mx, my] }) => {
  setActive(active)
  anime({
    targets: el,
    translateX: active ? mx : 0,
    translateY: active ? my : 0,
    duration: active ? 0 : 1000
  })
})

// when you want to remove the listener
gesture.destroy()
```

> The vanilla api is new from v10 and still experimental. Feel free to contribute!
